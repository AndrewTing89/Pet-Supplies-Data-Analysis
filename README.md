# Data Analyst Associate Practical Exam

## Introduction:
This repository showcases the practical exam for the Data Analyst Associate position. The project revolves around a dataset containing information about various pet supplies, such as product details, sales, ratings, and repeat purchases. The objective of this examination was to delve deep into data exploration, cleaning, visualization, and deriving actionable insights.

## Tasks Overview:
1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning:**
   - For every column in the dataset:
     - Verify if the values match the given description.
     - Identify and handle missing values.
     - Implement necessary transformations to align data with the provided description.

2. **Visualization and Analysis of Repeat Purchases:**
   - Create a visualization showcasing the number of products that are repeat purchases.
   - Identify the category of the "repeat purchases" variable with the most observations.
   - Discuss the distribution of observations across the categories of the "repeat purchases" variable.

## Techniques and Tools:
1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning:** Utilized Python's Pandas library to inspect the dataset, identify missing or inconsistent data, and implement transformations to rectify these inconsistencies.
2. **Data Visualization:** Employed Python's Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to craft insightful visualizations that highlight the distribution of repeat purchases.
3. **Data Analysis:** Leveraged Python to derive insights from the data, especially focusing on the patterns related to repeat purchases and their implications.

## Findings and Recommendations:
1. **Repeat Purchases Analysis:** A significant number of products were identified as repeat purchases, indicating a consistent and reliable consumer base for these products. This suggests the presence of a loyal customer segment.
   
2. **Recommendations based on Analysis:**
   - **Promote Repeat Purchase Products:** Amplify promotions around products with repeat purchases using loyalty programs, subscription models, or bundle deals.
   - **Study High-Value Outliers:** Investigate products with exceptionally high sales to identify strategies that can be applied to other products.
   - **Diversify Product Offerings:** Introduce new products or variations in the repeat purchases category to attract more customers.
   - **Engage Feedback Loop:** Set up a feedback mechanism to understand the reasons behind the repeat purchases.
   - **Leverage Data for Forecasting:** Use sales patterns for inventory management and sales forecasting to ensure optimal stock levels.

## How to Use:
1. **Environment Setup:**
   - Ensure you have Python installed, preferably Python 3.7 or later.
   - Install necessary libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn. You can use the following command:
     ```
     pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
     ```
